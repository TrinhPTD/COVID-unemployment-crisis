# Impact of COVID-19 on US unemployment

Losing a job is not only devastating to the individual and affected household, but is also a
major economic issue. Okun’s law, named after Yale Economist Arthur Okun, states that
even a 1 percent increase in US unemployment causes a reduction in US GDP by 2 percent
(Kenton, 2020). With the recent global health crisis, job loss has drastically increased and
the goal of this paper is to explore publicly available demographic and infection rate data, in
order to understand the variables that most impact job loss and to predict the likelihood of
losing one’s job. Whether the household has experienced job loss is the target variable.

The final model, built in SAS Enterprise Miner, was a logistic regression model with a
misclassification rate of 35%. Some identified variables of importance were Education,
Income, Age, Health Insurance Coverage, Metropolitan Statistical Area, Government
Response Index, Infection Rate and Number of Adults in the Household. The created model
can be used as a resource for predicting geographic regions that are likely to experience
increased levels in job loss based off the demographics of that region.
